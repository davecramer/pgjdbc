<h3>Fixed</h3>

<ul>
<li>Regression caused by https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/commit/4fa2d5bc1ed8c0086a3a197fc1c28f7173d53cac. Unfortunately
due to the blocking nature of the driver and issues with seeing if there is a byte available on a blocking stream when it is encrypted
this introduces unacceptable delays in returning from peek(). At this time there is no simple solution to this.</li>
