					<h1>Community</h1>
					<p>
						PostgreSQL is well supported by its active community. Current developments are chronicled
						at <a href="https://planet.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">PostgreSQL Planet News</a>
						and there are more than a dozen <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/community/lists" target="_blank">mailing lists</a>
						available, categorized into topics like administration, announcements,
						jobs, performance, and SQL.
					</p>

					<p>
						The PostgreSQL JDBC Driver is a subset of the PostgreSQL database active community that
						strives to create a compliant Java interface for users. There is a mailing list but most of 
						the development and discussion occurs on the github page <a href="https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc">pgJDBC</a>.
